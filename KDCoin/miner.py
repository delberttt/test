# todo: Idea is for every miner to have its own flask app
# Miner's capabilities:
# - contains list of transactions
# - contains Blockchain
# - Ability to add blocks to the chain automatically
#   - Should automatically reward himself if he's the first to find
# - Ability to broadcast new block/ interrupt if broadcast received
# - Keeping track of balance is done either through UTXO or account balance
# - How to verify transaction?
